  "summary": "The diff correctly implements REQ-17 by changing the notification interval in frontend/public/sw.js from 6 hours to 4 hours (14,400,000 ms). The constant NOTIFICATION_INTERVAL_MS is set to 4 * 60 * 60 * 1000, comments reference '4 hours', and no references to the old 6-hour interval remain. The notification logic (motivational quotes, message handling) is unchanged.",
