  "summary": "The diff implements the vast majority of requirements comprehensively. All 9 REQs have substantial implementation evidence. Backend covers workout schedules with full CRUD, motivational messages with 5 seeds, and user profiles. Frontend covers Today's Workout, Schedule, Progress, authentication via Internet Identity, and dark fitness theme. Minor notes: the streak calculation only counts backwards from today within the current week rather than strictly consecutive days, but the core requirement is met. Overall implementation is thorough.",

      "reason": "REQ-3 requires storing a notificationsEnabled field in the profile data model, but the build request explicitly lists push notifications as a non-goal ('not supported on this platform'). Surfacing a notifications toggle in the profile setup UI implies push notification support to the user, which was explicitly excluded.",
