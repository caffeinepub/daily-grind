  "summary": "Both REQ-37 and REQ-38 appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-37 is addressed by fixing App.tsx to use a dedicated /today route with the root / redirecting to /today, eliminating the Not Found fallthrough. REQ-38 is addressed by setting staleTime: 0 on useGetWorkoutSchedules and ensuring all mutation hooks call queryClient.invalidateQueries with the same workoutSchedules key.",
