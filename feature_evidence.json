When a logged-in user grants notification permission, schedule a repeating local notification (via the Notifications API and a Service Worker with a periodic alarm or setTimeout-based scheduler) that fires every 6 hours while the browser/PWA is running or backgrounded. Each notification should include a reminder message to complete their daily workout and a motivational quote fetched from the backend's existing random motivational message endpoint.",
