Inspect the save/submit handler, the mutation hook invocation (in `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts`), and the data shape being passed to the backend (including the new `setRows` array field). Ensure the mutation correctly calls the backend `createScheduleEntry` or `updateScheduleEntry` function with a valid payload — including all required fields (`day`, `workoutName`, `workoutDetails`, `timeReminder`, `setRows`) — and that errors are surfaced to the user rather than silently swallowed. After fixing, the Save button must successfully persist the entry and trigger a schedule query invalidation/refetch.",
