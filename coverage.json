Each set row must have a unique ID, a text description (e.g., '3x10 Bench Press'), and a completed boolean. Update the `WorkoutSchedule` type and all relevant CRUD API functions (`createScheduleEntry`, `updateScheduleEntry`, `getScheduleForUser`) to accept and return set rows. The existing plain-text `workoutDetails` field must remain backward-compatible (entries without set rows continue to work).",
